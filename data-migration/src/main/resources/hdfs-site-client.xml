        <description>
            If there is a datanode/network failure in the write pipeline,
            DFSClient will try to remove the failed datanode from the pipeline
            and then continue writing with the remaining datanodes. As a result,
            the number of datanodes in the pipeline is decreased. The feature is
            to add new datanodes to the pipeline.

            This is a site-wide property to enable/disable the feature.

            When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster
            administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default
            configuration file or disable this feature. Otherwise, users may
            experience an unusually high rate of pipeline failures since it is
            impossible to find new datanodes for replacement.

        <value>NEVER</value>
        <description>
            This property is used only if the value of
            dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable is true.

            ALWAYS: always add a new datanode when an existing datanode is removed.

            NEVER: never add a new datanode.

            DEFAULT:
            Let r be the replication number.
            Let n be the number of existing datanodes.
            Add a new datanode only if r is greater than or equal to 3 and either
            (1) floor(r/2) is greater than or equal to n; or
            (2) r is greater than n and the block is hflushed/appended.
